# 🎓 Student Performance Prediction App  

This project is a **Machine Learning based web application** that predicts student performance based on various academic and personal factors such as study hours, attendance, and extracurricular activities.  

Built with **Python, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit**, the app allows users to input student details and get instant predictions on whether the student is likely to **pass or fail** (or predict their score, depending on the trained model).
