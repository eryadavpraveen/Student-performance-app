This project is a Machine Learning based web application that predicts student performance based on various academic and personal factors such as study hours, attendance, and extracurricular activities.

Built with Python, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit, the app allows users to input student details and get instant predictions on whether the student is likely to pass or fail (or predict their score, depending on the trained model).
