# 🎓 Student Performance Prediction App  

This project is a **Machine Learning based web application** that predicts student performance based on various academic and personal factors such as study hours, attendance, and extracurricular activities.  

Built with **Python, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit**, the app allows users to input student details and get instant predictions on whether the student is likely to **pass or fail** (or predict their score, depending on the trained model).

## 🚀 Features
- 📊 Predict student performance using ML models  
- 📝 Simple and interactive **Streamlit UI**  
- 🔧 Preprocessing with Scikit-learn (scaling, encoding, etc.)  
- 💾 Model saved using Joblib/Pickle for real-time prediction  
- ☁️ Easy deployment on Streamlit Cloud or Heroku  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)  
- **Machine Learning** (Regression / Classification models)  
- **Streamlit** for web app  
- **Joblib** for model persistence
